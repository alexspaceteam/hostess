# 🎉 Hostess - Your Server's Friendly Greeter

Upon joining your Minecraft Server, Steve and other players see:

> _"Welcome Steve to SpaceWars!"_

Your smart speeker says:

> _Steve has just joined to your SpaceWars Server_

**Hostess** is a lightweight Minecraft plugin that gives your players a warm welcome—and gives *you* a heads-up through your smart home. When a player joins, they get a friendly message, and you get an instant notification via **Alexa** or **Google Home** (or both, if you're feeling fancy).

Whether you're running a private server for friends or a bustling community hub, Hostess makes sure no one sneaks in unnoticed—and everyone feels at home.

## 🧠 Why use Hostess?

Because the default join message is boring.  
Because you want to hear your smart speaker say “Oh no, not *him* again.”  
Because your server deserves some *class*.
